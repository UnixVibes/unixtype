# Advanced Sound Effects System

## Overview
A professional-grade audio system that transforms typing into an immersive, game-like experience with mechanical keyboard sounds, crowd cheering, boss battle music, and epic victory fanfares‚Äîall generated using the Web Audio API with **zero audio files**.

## Features Implemented

### üéπ **Mechanical Keyboard Sounds**

#### Cherry MX Blue Style Clicks
Realistic mechanical keyboard simulation:

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
