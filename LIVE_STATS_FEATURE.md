# Live Stats Dashboard Feature

## Overview
A comprehensive real-time analytics dashboard that provides users with detailed performance insights, beautiful data visualizations, and actionable feedback on their typing test results.

## Features Implemented

### 1. LiveStats Component (`components/LiveStats.tsx`)

#### Performance Metrics Cards
Four animated metric cards displaying key statistics:

- **Current WPM** (Teal gradient)
  - Shows final/current typing speed
  - Live indicator during active tests
  - Animated background glow

- **Average WPM** (Purple gradient)
  - Mean speed across entire test
  - Helps identify overall performance level

- **Peak Speed** (Green gradient)
  - Maximum WPM achieved during test
  - Highlights best performance moment

- **Consistency** (Purple gradient)
  - Calculated using coefficient of variation
  - Percentage showing rhythm stability
  - Rating: Excellent (80+%), Good (60-79%), Variable (<60%)

#### WPM Over Time Chart
Beautiful area chart showing speed progression:

- **Visual Design**
  - Gradient-filled area under curve
  - Smooth line connecting data points
  - Grid lines for easy reading
  - Time (seconds) on X-axis
  - WPM on Y-axis

- **Interactive Features**
  - Custom tooltips on hover
  - Glass-morphism styling
  - "Recording" badge during live tests
  - Animated rendering

- **Summary Statistics**
  - Lowest WPM point
  - Average WPM
  - Highest WPM point

#### Keystroke Heatmap
Horizontal bar chart showing typing patterns:

- **Data Visualization**
  - Top 10 most-typed keys
  - Purple gradient bars
  - Sorted by frequency
  - Custom tooltips

- **Insights**
  - Character frequency distribution
  - Typing pattern analysis
  - Identifies commonly used keys

#### Performance Insights
AI-powered feedback system with actionable tips:

- **Excellent Speed** ðŸš€
  - Triggers: 80+ WPM average
  - Message: "Faster than 85% of users"
  - Green badge with success theme

- **Very Consistent** ðŸŽ¯
  - Triggers: 80%+ consistency
  - Message: "Steady and reliable rhythm"
  - Purple badge

- **High Accuracy** âœ¨
  - Triggers: 95%+ accuracy
  - Message: "Very few mistakes"
  - Teal badge

- **Maintain Rhythm** ðŸ’¡
  - Triggers: Low consistency (<60%) OR high variance (>30 WPM difference)
  - Message: "Try maintaining a steady pace"
  - Accent color badge with tip

- **Trend Detection** ðŸ“Š
  - Analyzes first vs last data points
  - "Strong Finish!" if improving
  - "Started Strong!" if declining
  - Provides contextual feedback

### 2. Data Tracking System

#### Keystroke Tracking
Real-time character frequency monitoring:

```typescript
// Tracks each character typed
keystrokeData: {
  'a': 45,
  'e': 38,
  's': 32,
  // ... etc
}
```

#### WPM History
Per-second speed tracking:

```typescript
// Array of WPM values at 1-second intervals
wpmHistory: [25, 32, 45, 58, 62, ...]
```

### 3. Integration Points

#### TypingTest Component
- Tracks every keystroke in `handleInputChange`
- Stores character frequency
- Maintains WPM history array
- Passes data to TestResult

#### ResultScreen Component
- Conditionally renders LiveStats
- Only shows if WPM history exists
- Positioned after fortune cookie
- Full-width dashboard layout
- Smooth fade-in animation

#### TestResult Type
Extended with analytics data:
```typescript
interface TestResult {
  // ... existing fields
  wpmHistory?: number[];
  keystrokeData?: Record<string, number>;
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
- **recharts** (v3.3.0): Professional chart library
  - Area charts for trends
  - Bar charts for distribution
  - Responsive containers
  - Custom tooltips

### Chart Configurations

#### Area Chart (WPM Over Time)
```typescript
- Gradient fill: #14b8a6 (teal) with opacity fade
- Stroke width: 3px
- Smooth curve interpolation
- Grid with 3-3 dash pattern
- Custom tooltip with glass effect
```

#### Bar Chart (Keystroke Heatmap)
```typescript
- Horizontal layout
- Purple fill (#8b5cf6)
- Rounded corners (8px)
- Custom category axis
- Hover tooltips
```

### Styling Approach
- Glass-morphism effects throughout
- Gradient backgrounds on cards
- Hover scale animations (1.02x)
- Color-coded performance levels
- Consistent border radius (xl, 2xl)
- Responsive grid layouts

## User Experience Flow

### During Test
1. System tracks WPM every second
2. Keystroke data accumulated
3. No visual distraction (data stored silently)

### After Test Completion
1. Test result calculated
2. Navigate to ResultScreen
3. See rank badge and stats
4. Read fortune cookie message
5. **Scroll down to LiveStats dashboard**
6. Explore performance graphs
7. Read personalized insights
8. Understand typing patterns
9. Get actionable improvement tips

## Performance Insights Algorithm

### Speed Categories
- **Beginner**: <40 WPM
- **Intermediate**: 40-60 WPM
- **Advanced**: 60-80 WPM
- **Expert**: 80-100 WPM
- **Master**: 100+ WPM

### Consistency Calculation
```javascript
const mean = average(wpmHistory)
const variance = average(wpmHistory.map(wpm => (wpm - mean)Â²))
const stdDev = sqrt(variance)
const consistency = (1 - (stdDev / mean)) * 100
```

### Insight Triggers
